When using this skill, you will need to link your Nest account. When linking
your account, you will be asked to allow the skill to control the home/away
state of your Nest homes. This process generates a random secure password that
is used by the skill. This password is stored by Amazon and only provided to the
skill to complete user requests. This password is not visible to any developers
of this skill, nor is it stored by the skill in any way. The skill, however,
may store the name of your Nest home in diagnostic logs which are only visible
to the developers of this skill. These diagnostic logs are anonymous and are not
tied to your Amazon account in any way.
