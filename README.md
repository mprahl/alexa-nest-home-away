# Alexa Nest Home/Away Smart Home Switch Skill

Control the away state of your Nest homes using Alexa smart home switches.
This allows you to ask Alexa to turn on and turn off your Nest home, which sets
the away state of your home (e.g. triggers Eco on your thermostat). Since your
Nest homes are represented as Alexa smart home switches, you may control your
Nest home's away state using voice commands, the Alexa app, and Alexa routines.

Please note that the Nest API rate limits the number of on/off requests one
can do per hour, which will cause Alexa to say the device is unresponsive when
the limit has been exceeded.
